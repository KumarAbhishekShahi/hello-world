<h1>Welcome to GKE Deployment using Github Actions.</h1>
<p>This sample includes below steps,</p>
<p>Download and configure the Google Cloud SDK with the provided credentials.</p>
<p>Build, tag, and push a container image to Google Container Registry.</p></p>
<p>Use a Kubernetes Deployment to push the image to the cluster.</p>
<p>Note that a GKE deployment requires a unique Tag to update the pods. Using a constant tag latest or a branch name master may result in successful workflows that don't update the cluster.</p>
